It is based on the core FHIR [Observation](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/observation.html) resource and identifies the *additional* mandatory core elements, extensions, vocabularies and value sets that **SHALL** be present in the Observation resource when conforming to this profile. It provides the floor for standards development for specific uses cases in an Australian context. \n\n Biological sex assigned at birth refers to what was determined by sex characteristics observed at birth or infancy, including genital and chromosome composition. Sex assigned at birth is captured once for a patient and is not expected to change within their lifetime.",
